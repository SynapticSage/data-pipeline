# VIDEO LIBRARY DESIRABLES
  --------------------
1. ~~PERSIST VIDEOREADER if same as previous call! This can help for sequential reads.
    hash videoFile : persist the hash --> if hash persisted different from new hash, load, else use persisted object~~
2. WRITE TO HDF
    Ability to write to hdf with matfile as decompressed uint 8 frames ...  allows much faster playback later
3. IMRESIZE factor : scale factor given to shrink video by (helps even more with fitting decompressed video in memory); 
4. IMCROP bounds : even more
